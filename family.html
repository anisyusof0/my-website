<td><b>A family is a social group of people who stay together under the same roof in a society. It comprises two or more adults like 
parents and grandparents and young children who are bound in a relationship by birth or blood. They are collectively known as family members. Each 
family member is committed to each other in a mutual relationship. A family holds a special place in the life of an individual and the society in 
which he/she lives. I cannot imagine living my life without my family by my side. Family is very important and valuable to me and is something that 
should never be taken for granted. Without my family, a large part of my life and culture would be missing.
<br>
<br>
This is my small family. The head of our family is our father, Encik Mohamad Yusof bin Rahmat who is 47 years old. We called him "abah". Abah married our mother, Puan Siti
